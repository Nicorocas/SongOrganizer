# SongOrganizer

I have several folders filled with unorganized songs, each one named title.mp3. SongOrganizer is a script I created to organize this madness, placing each one in a specific folder, depending the artist's name. 

## Version v1.0 

After testing v0.0, I realised it was too flawed. This version correctly fixes the issues of the previous version, and introduces the possibility (in fact the requirement) of specifying the origin and destination of the files as first and second arguments of the script, respectively.


## Version v0.0

This is the original script. It hasn't been tested yet.
